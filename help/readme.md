The Karp Project
===================

This project named after [Richard M. Karp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Karp).

It is a tool set for my daily work, for example, many times we need to compare the difference between the counters
before and after the problem happened, we can provide a easy way for user to do the comparison automatically,
rather than manually.

A lot more such kind of tools will be added gradually to improve the engineering performance.

Karp is open sourced and MIT licensed.

## How to Install

As it is a very simple tool set so no need to setup database. Just:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tyrchen/karp.git
    $ # in your virtualenv
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt


## How to Use

I think it is self-explanatory. Should not hard to use it.
